<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>Open the app and the locations of nearby pubs will be displayed.
  
<p>Red pubs are at full capacity
<p>Orange pubs are 1/3 to 2/3 full
<p>Green are up to 1/3 full

<p>The fullness is based on the previous weeks busy-ness (so 100% full means it is the highest it has been in the last week).

<p>Please bear in mind this is a work in progress, any suggestions are always welcome on how to refine, as are feature requests.
