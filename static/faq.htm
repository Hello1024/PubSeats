<h2>When will I get my gift?</h2>
We will deliver randomly in the next 2 months, so your gift is a true surprise!

<h2>What if I don't know what my gift is?</h2>
Try asking on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guerillagifts/">reddit</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=What%20is%20this%20%23guerillagift%20?">twitter</a>.  If nobody knows, it's time to get creative with it :-).

<h2>My gift is useless</h2>
So you got a screen protector for a phone you don't have, a casette tape from the 1970's, or a bicycle repair kit when you don't have a bicycle?  Sorry about that!  Our gifts are very random, and sometimes a little too random to be useful.  Clearly, your new challange is to find a friend who can make use of whatever random you've received.  <a href=https://twitter.com/home?status=Made%20use%20of%20my%20useless%20%23guerillagift%20! >Let everyone know</a> how it goes!

<h2>Is my gift truly random?</h2>
No.  We've filtered out clearly illegal things, and things that look too good to be true (one supplier tried to sell us a Boeing plane for $0.99!).  Thats it though.  Everything else is thrown in the pot and distributed 100% at random!

<h2>Are all gifts new?</h2>
Yes.  No gifts are pre-owned/used/2nd hand.  Some might be made of recycled materials though.

<h2>I want to complain!</h2>
Our margins are razor thin because we want to get you the best gifts possible, and it's just two of us running the whole thing in our spare time, so begin by asking on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guerillagifts/">reddit</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=%23guerillagift%20has%20screwed%20me%20over!">twitter</a>.  Failing that, use the in-app "refund and close my account" button.  Beware though, the refund button is a one way shop - once you've taken a refund, you won't be able to use guerilla gifts ever again :-(.

<h2>Where do you get the gifts from?</h2>
We have a selection of suppliers in Hong Kong and Shenzen, China.  They ship the gifts direct to you with the cheapest possible shipping to leave the most $$$'s for your gift.

<h2>How much do you spend on each gift?</h2>
Well, that would be telling...   But they all vary between $0.50 and $3.  This site doesn't make a profit.

<h2>How many gifts do you have?</h2>
Each day we find more - the goal is nobody should ever receive the same gift twice, and you're very unlikley to get the same gift as a friend.

<h2>I want to buy another of the item you sent me</h2>
Ask on reddit or twitter to see if someone can find one for sale.  If you're lucky, one of us will peer into the database of random and send you a link to buy it if it's on public sale somewhere (most of these items are also available on ebay or aliexpress).

<h2>Is my gift safe?</h2>
While we are not aware of any unsafe items that we ship, we have not vetted these items for safety.  It is your responsibility to verify that they meet all local rules and regulations before use, and to dispose of any items which aren't up to scratch.  If you live in the USA, we're scared of your lawsuit happy culture, so bear in mind that all gifts are not to be touched and for decorative purposes only.

<h2>Customs want me to pay taxes on my gift!</h2>
We try to only take gifts that fall under tax allowances worldwide.  If you get asked to pay taxes, let us know, and tell customs to destroy the item.

<h2>My gift is an electrical item, but has the wrong plug!</h2>
Find an adaptor?

<h2>I want a different billing/delivery address.</h2>
For simplicity, we always ship to the address on your payment method.  Sorry!

<h2>Can I set up a subscription?</h2>
Yes - for each payment, we will send one gift.  You can cancel anytime by cancelling the recurring payment.
